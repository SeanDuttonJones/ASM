# Description
A fully featured Abstract Stack Machine (ASM).

This project aims to implement an ASM which runs a custom language similar to x86 assembly. It has taken inspiration from both x86 and JVM bytecode.

The ASM supports instructions for both floating point and integer arithmetic, control flow, memory allocation, and much more!

Language documentation is being developed and will be available soon!
